While Snowdrop doesn't include an icon set by default, we do have our own comprehensive icon library called Snowdrop Icons. Feel free to use them or any other icon set in your project. We've included details for Snowdrop Icons and other preferred icon sets below.

While most icon sets include multiple file formats, we prefer SVG implementations for their improved accessibility and vector support.

## Snowdrop Icons

Snowdrop Icons is a growing library of SVG icons that are designed by [@mdo](https://github.com/mdo) and maintained by [the Snowdrop Team](https://github.com/orgs/twbs/people). The beginnings of this icon set come from Snowdrop's very own componentsâ€”our forms, carousels, and more. Snowdrop has very few icon needs out of the box, so we didn't need much. However, once we got going, we couldn't stop making more.

Oh, and did we mention they're completely open source? Licensed under MIT, just like Snowdrop, our icon set is available to everyone.

## Alternatives

We've tested and used these icon sets ourselves as preferred alternatives to Snowdrop Icons.

{{< markdown >}}
{{< icons.inline >}}
{{- $type := .Get "type" | default "preferred" -}}

{{- range (index .Site.Data.icons $type) }}
- [{{ .name }}]({{ .website }})
{{- end }}
{{< /icons.inline >}}
{{< /markdown >}}

## More options

While we haven't tried these out ourselves, they do look promising and provide multiple formats, including SVG.
